This is a custom designed bottle opener, shackle key, and marlin spike combination tool that I designed for my dad to give out as a award for the Sunset Sailing Series at Sequoia YC. The design is derived from the somewhat ubiquitous [shackle key](https://marine.wichard.com/en/stainless-steel-hardware/accessories/shackle-keys/part-10303) designs (comparison below), but seeks to make some improvements.

The main issue with the existing design is that the bottle opener is in the wrong orientation to the handle and and the engagement angle ends up almost parallel to the bottle, also they seem to be very aggressively tumbled to remove casting/forging marks which leads to the hook being completely rounded over.
Additionally the existing shackle keys have a steep enough angle that they have a hard time with smaller shackles that don't have a particularly wide head.

Then there were three other objectives partly at odds with each other, first it should be machinable in two setups on a 3 axis mill, second it should be pointy enough to be used as a marlin spike, and third it <b>NEEDS</b> to look cool.
<br>
What became immediately apparent is that there needed to be a flat outer facet as opposed to the C2 continuity full rounded edge style that everyone typically goes for. [Good introduction on the kinds of continuity here.] (https://www.core77.com/posts/12752/a-periodic-table-of-form-the-secret-language-of-surface-and-meaning-in-product-design-by-gray-holland-12752)  By having flat facets you solve a number of problems in one go, you get a much larger engagement face than having a radiused tip, you gain a reasonable amount of AMoI in the narrow sides, and it becomes easy to hold in soft jaws. And thus we get the revision I have already shown.

This is how it arrived to me from Shapeways, binder jet out of a 60/40 blend of 420 Stainless and Bronze, which at the time was marketed as stainless. The layer marks from the binder jetting were pretty substantial, the porosity of the surface roughness goes pretty deep, and it was reasonably warped. I blame this mostly on binder jetting being the wrong process for me to use for this part, I attempted to finish the surface with files, wet sanding, sand blasting, pin tumbling, and ect to no avail.

You can see how most of the defects have been removed, but what remains would require substantial material removal to remove while keeping the form of the part. On the second version which is revised per my dads feedback, which he uses to this day as well as some of the people who received them as awards, there was substantial corrosion issues with salt water, partly because of the porosity and partly because of the wrong choice in material.
<br>
Here is the second version, which has a much pointier geometry to make it a effective marlin spike.
