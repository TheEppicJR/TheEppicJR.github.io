In my senior year of highschool I made a statue as part of the final project for my creative writing class. The statue goes along with some rather cringe poems I am willfully omitting, but the general gist was comparing types of material failure and the [swiss cheese model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model) of failure analysis to the human condition.
<br>
From top to bottom, the layers represent:
- Tensile failure
- Shear failure
- Buckling
- Bending
- Fatigue
<br>
...and to be clear, this selection is entirely based around what I could write a poem about.

Here is wikipedia's image of the swiss cheese model for comparison, so you can see where my <i>subtle</i> imaginary is coming from.

But the real reason why I personally enjoy this project is the part that no one sees, the underneath of the base with a nice 3d machines freeform surface:

Here is a 3d model of it with some fancier hardware, but in reality I designed and made this the day before it was due so there was no MMC order involved.
