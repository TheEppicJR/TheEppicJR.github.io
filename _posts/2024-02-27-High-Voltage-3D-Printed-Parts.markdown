This is a series of 3D printed parts that I designed for the 2021-2022 San Jose State Formula SAE Electric car, all of these were designed as revisions or clean slate redesigns of the plan of record as I encountered issues while helping the electric powertrain team finish the accumulator.
<br>
The first pair of parts I made were the handles for the maintenance plugs that are used to disconnect accumulator segments within the pack.

These were made as a two part clamshell, as mirrored parts for the long busbars and as a top and bottom for the short busbars. Because they are made of ABS they can be solvent welded together with ABS pipe cement (or if you care to match the colors, acetone).

I cannot impress upon you how robust these ended up being with a image, so here is the sound of me dropping one of them on the table so you can hear how solid they are.

Additionally to go along with the maintenance plugs I made guides to help align the plugs as well as more robustly protect the aluminum tray from the pins of the module and the Radsok connectors. These were also made as two pieces that were solvent welded together so that they could be printed without support or overhangs.

The other parts I made were to mount the busbars to the aluminum tray, These were made with a aluminum insert that was press fit into the part after printing and then match drilled to fit rivets, with a MS21059-3K nutplates on the far side of the 3d printed geometry. This allows for a compact positively retained electrically insulated and non-compressible mounting solution. that is required to join the busbars to each other and the 'penthouse' tray.

And as a final extra fun part I made some tie in brackets for the penthouse handle, which was a spliced piece of kevlar with a heatshrink cover (because the uncovere kevlar would quickly become slightly conductive with metal powder). These brackets were made of glass filled Ultem, but from every angle this was a poor design, it was a bad shape and the Ultem was brittle and cracked when the cherry max rivets were set.
