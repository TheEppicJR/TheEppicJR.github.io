This is a project I did for my friend Pete Oxenham, now Founder of the startup Chatter.dev, who at the time owned a machine shop FTR CNC along with its sister company Fully Torqued Racing (FTR) which was a aftermarket automotive supplier. At this point in time the first generation of Starlink terminals had just arrived on the market, and we believed that there was a reasonable market for a aesthetically pleasing antenna mast for the terminal that would lift the antenna significantly off the roof and help see a bit more of the sky over the treeline.

This product would fit very nicely into FTR's product line because they had a existing product (front splitter supports pictured above) that used a carbon fiber tube with bonded aluminum ends, that used spherical rod ends, so most of the components needed for this new product line were already stocked. We were targeting a prosumer market and with a goal to make a product that mirrored the aesthetics of the aerospace industry with their ultra-light designs while being robust enough for a layman to be mounting to their roof without trouble.

My personal feeling, and I'm sure this is a substantive topic in the formal understanding of design that I am not privy to, is that the highlights from the reflected light off of a object convey to the viewer most of the feelings about its form. That is to say that what makes the most reflections - from a majority viewing angles - is radiuses and therefore getting the look and feel of the radiuses right is the most important part to being able to match the most rememberable parts of the aesthetic we are matching, and DFM will guide us the rest of the way.

I will use the MARDI instrument from the Mars Science Laboratory as pictured above as a example of the aesthetics I am talking about. There are five aspects which I think are critical to the aesthetic and all also have a functional purpose.
1. Prominent big triangular ribs that have a form that exactly follows the load path, which is its function.
2. Rather gentle fillets at the ends of the ribs that typically exist to allow the top face of the rib to be machined with the side of the tool, and the sharp corner that would net be easily machinable would also act as a stress riser.
3. The very small fillets at the base of the ribs that are are there to prevent a stress riser and are easily machined with a bull nose endmill (on MARDI they are abnormally large).
4. The fillet that exists where the rib meets the mounting face it is supporting (normal to the direction of the tool used to machine the walls of the rib). 5. Counterbores that cut into the the radiuses mentioned in the forth point.
